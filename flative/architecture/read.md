# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
All architectures presented here are experimental in nature. These sketches represent ongoing experiments and evolving designs rather than permanent solutions.

## Version Control
- Architectural diagrams and designs are versioned using the format: `arch_[number]`
- Latest version (highest number) represents the current implementation
- Previous versions are preserved for reference

## Note
As experimentation continues, changes will be made to reflect new insights and improvements. Historical versions remain accessible to track the evolution of design decisions.

## Current Version
Please refer to the highest numbered architecture (`arch_[n]`) for the most recent implementation.
